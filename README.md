# Quantum-Phase-Estimation-with-Qiskit-
A project on Quantum Phase estimation using Qiskit to look at errors of measurement of quantum system. 

This was my final project for my Quantum Information course. I had to learn IBM's Qiskit package as well as about Quantum Computation. 
This project deals with Quantum Phase Estimation and builds up the algorithim by discussing how it works mathematicaly. 
Later I show some results of measurement and discuss non-zero errors arising and how they explain the nature of the QPE solving 
the hidden subgroup problem and how it pertains to more specific Quantum algorithims such as Shor's algorithim which uses QPE as a 
subroutine to find the prime factorization of a number essentially.

Please put something like 'Github Quantum Computing' in the subject line of the email.
